- 👋  Hello there! I’m @loopy-ux
- 👀 I’m a Computer Science and Technology student from Chongqing, China 🇨🇳.
- 💚 As a front-end enthusiast, I love crafting dynamic and user-friendly web experiences.
- ✍️ HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue.js.
- 🌱 Looking for front-end internships to level up my skills and work with awesome teams.
- 💞️ One of my dreams is to launch a personal blog. Stay tuned for updates! 🚀
- ✍️(A place to share coding insights, tutorials, and my learning journey)
- ✨ Off-screen, I recharge by swimming 🏊‍♂️ or playing with dogs 🐶 (they’re the best stress relievers!).
- 😄 Excited to connect and grow together. Happy coding! 💻✨
