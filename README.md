- 👋  Hello there! I’m @loopy-ux
- 👀 I’m a Computer Science and Technology student from Chongqing, China 🇨🇳.
-  As a front-end enthusiast, I love crafting dynamic and user-friendly web experiences.
-  My toolkit includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue.js (my current favorite! 💚).
-  I’m eager to explore more frameworks and build projects that solve real problems.
- 🌱 Right now, I’m on the lookout for front-end internships to level up my skills and work with awesome teams.
- Let’s chat! Whether it’s tech, open-source, or career advice, I’m all ears. 🤝
- 💞️ One of my dreams is to launch a personal blog ✍️—a place to share coding insights, tutorials, and my learning journey.
-  Stay tuned for updates! 🚀
- 📫 You can reach me by my e-mail "3352905048@qq.com".
- ✨ Off-screen, I recharge by swimming 🏊‍♂️ or playing with dogs 🐶 (they’re the best stress relievers!).
- 😄 Excited to connect and grow together. Happy coding! 💻✨
